Explanation of Sections:
meta: Contains basic job details and the full job description for reference.

keyRequirements: A list of extracted key requirements from the job description to facilitate matching.

narrative: A crafted summary in the third person, similar to a cover letter highlight.

alignment: Detailed matching of skills, projects, experience, cultural fit, and education.

skills: Each skill includes your proficiency, the job's requirement level, a match score, and evidence.

projectHighlights and experienceHighlights: Reference items from your knowledge-base with relevance and match scores.

culturalFit: For soft skills and cultural aspects often mentioned in job descriptions.

educationFit: If education is a key requirement, this section can highlight its relevance.

For each job application, generate a unique ID (e.g., company-role in lowercase with hyphens).

Fill in the meta section with job details.

Extract and list the keyRequirements from the job description.

Write a compelling narrative based on the job's needs and your strengths.

Populate the alignment sections by referencing your knowledge-base.json (using IDs for projects and experience).

Set fields to null if not applicable (e.g., culturalFit might be null for highly technical roles).
